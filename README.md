# Multiplayer-Game
This project is a multiplayer game where users can create accounts, login to an arena, battle other users, and gain rewards/perks through in game powerups.

This game is written using Javascript, HTML, and CSS

I use Node.js and Express to create a backend server to run the game. 

User data/progress is cryptographically secured and stored in a MongDB database that used Mongoose models to strucutre data

Socket.io is used to send data between client and server, establishing multiplayer capabilites.
